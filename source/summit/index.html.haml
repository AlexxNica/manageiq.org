        ## Program

        The summit presents an excellent opportunity to engage with your fellow
        community members. Perhaps on how adopting ManageIQ has streamlined your
        projectâ€™s workflow, the different integration efforts and use-cases,
        proposing new feature implementations, or maybe even some challenges
        faced and lessons-learned.

        Call for papers is now open, please check the details and submit your
        talk proposals at [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/miqsummit2016)
        (convenient login with your Github, Twitter, Google or Facebook accounts).

        Deadline for submission: **March 31, 2016**

        Acceptance and agenda will be announced in mid-April.

        ### Airports

        The closest major airport is Newark Liberty International Airport
        ([EWR](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/newark-liberty.html)) in New
        Jersey. If you are flying in, we highly recommend using that
        airport. Other airports in the area you can consider (especially
        if you're flying in from outside of the US) are LaGuardia Airport
        ([LGA](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/laguardia.html)) and John F.
        Kennedy International Airport
        ([JFK](http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk.html)), both in New York.
