          %option{:value => key, :data => info.slice("ext", "download_platform")}= info["name"]

      %select{:id => "release", :onchange => "downloadSelectionChanged()"}

            Warning
          Things may be unstable, and may break. If you're looking for adventure,
          please proceed.

      :javascript
        function downloadSelectionChanged() {
          platform = $("#platform").val();
          release  = $("#release").val();

          if (release != null && platform != null) {
            if (release != "stable")
              $(".release-warning").show();
            else
              $(".release-warning").hide();

            dl_platform = $("#platform option:selected").attr("data-download-platform");
            ext = $("#platform option:selected").attr("data-ext");
            filename = $("#release option:selected").attr("data-filename");

            replace_html = $("#instructions-template-" + platform).
              html().
              replace(/!!build_url!!/g, build_url(dl_platform, filename, ext)).
              replace(/!!build_filename!!/g, build_filename(dl_platform, filename, ext))

            $("#installation-step1").html(replace_html);
          }
        }

        function build_url(platform, filename, ext) {
          return "http://manageiq.org/download/" + build_filename(platform, filename, ext);
        }

        function build_filename(platform, filename, ext) {
          return "manageiq-" + platform + "-" + filename + "." + ext;
        }

        ### Step 1: **Download & deploy your appliance**

          1.  Download ManageIQ directly to OpenStack by running
              this com

      %div#instructions-template-openstack{:hidden => true}
        :markdown
          1.  Download ManageIQ directly to OpenStack by running
              this command:

              ~~~bash
              curl -O -L !!build_url!! && \
              glance image-create --name "!!build_filename!!" \
              --is-public True --disk-format qcow2 \
              --container-format=bare --file !!build_filename!!
              ~~~

          2.  Launch a new instance from the ManageIQ image. ManageIQ needs a
              minimum of 6GB RAM and a 45GB persistent disk, so choose or create
              an instance flavor accordingly.

      %div#instructions-template-ovirt{:hidden => true}
        %ol
          %li
            %p
              %a.download-link{:href => "!!build_url!!"}
                Download ManageIQ for oVirt
          %li
            %p
              When the file has finished downloading, upload it to
              an export domain on your oVirt instance by running the
              following command locally:

              :markdown
                ~~~bash
                engine-image-uploader -e $YOUR_EXPORT_DOMAIN --engine=$YOUR_ENGINE_HOST upload -v -m !!build_filename!!
                ~~~
          %li
            %p
              Navigate to the "Template Import" tab of your export
              domain in your oVirt admin console, and import the
              ManageIQ image template you uploaded.
          %li
            %p
              Create a new virtual machine from the ManageIQ
              template, and start the VM.

      %div#instructions-template-rhev{:hidden => true}
        %ol
          %li
            %p
              %a.download-link{:href => "!!build_url!!"}
                Download ManageIQ for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
          %li
            %p
              When the file has finished downloading, upload it to
              an export domain on your RHEV instance by running the
              following command locally:

              :markdown
                ~~~bash
                rhevm-image-uploader -e $YOUR_EXPORT_DOMAIN --engine=$YOUR_RHEVM_HOST upload -v -m !!build_filename!!
                ~~~
          %li
            %p
              Navigate to the "Template Import" tab of your export
              domain in your RHEV admin console, and import the
              ManageIQ image template you uploaded.
          %li
            %p
              Create a new virtual machine from the ManageIQ
              template, and start the VM.

      %div#instructions-template-vsphere{:hidden => true}
        :markdown
          1.  From the vSphere client, click File → Deploy OVF Template
              (or Actions → Deploy OVF Template from the vSphere Web client).

          2.  Enter `!!build_url!!`
              in the URL field of the resulting dialog window, and select
              the location, host and storage you wish to use for the ManageIQ VM.

          3.  Check the box "Power on after deployment" to start the VM
              once the deployment is complete.

      :markdown
        ### Step 2: **First connection and configuration**

        1.  Log into the ManageIQ dashboard by connecting to the new running VM
            with a web browser.
            The initial username and password is `admin`/`smartvm`.

        2.  There are a number of basic settings, located under
            "Configure → Configuration" in the web interface, or under
            "Advanced Settings" in the VM's console, that you may wish to
            change when starting ManageIQ for the first time. Among the
            most common are:

            * Time and date settings
            * DHCP configuration
            * Hostname
            * Admin password


        ### Step 3: **Add an infrastructure or cloud provider**

        Now that your ManageIQ Appliance is up and running, it's time to connect up
        with your Providers (Cloud or Infrastructure) and gather data about them.
