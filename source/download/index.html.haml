          - when 'vmware'
            :markdown
              [<i class="download-icon"></i>Download ManageIQ for VMware vSphere]
              (http://manageiq.org/downloads/ManageIQ-stable-vsphere.ova) to
              your local computer.

              In the vSphere Client, select File -> Deploy OVF Template. The
              Deploy OVF Template wizard appear, follow the instructions to
              upload the template


        :markdown
          ### Step 2: **First connection and configuration**

          * Create a new virtual machine friom the ManageIQ template. ManageIQ
            needs a minimum of 6GB RAM and 45GB persistent disk

          * Log into the ManageIQ dashboard by connecting to the new running VM
            with a web browser (Mozilla Firefox 16 or later, Internet Explorer 8
            or later, Google Chrome, and any other modern web browser should work).
            The initial username and password is `admin`/`smartvm`

          * There are a number of settings in "Advanced settings" which
            administrators need to change when starting ManageIQ for the first time.
            Among the most common are:
            * Time and date settings
            * DHCP configuration
            * Hostname
            * Admin password


          ### Step 3: **Add an infrastructure provider**

          Now that you are up and running, you can connect your first
          infrastructure provider and start gathering data about what is running
          there.

          To add a new provider, navigate to Infrastructure->Providers, click the
          configuration icon (TODO: include icon here), and "+" to add a new
          provider.

          * Select your infrastructure provider from the drop-down
          * If you have multiple zones, select the appropriate one in the drop-down
          * Type in a username and password, and click "Validate"

          You can also auto-discover providers available on your local network by
          clicking on the "radar" symbol (TODO: Include logo here). Check the
          infrastructure type, and a subnet range of IP addresses to search, and
          ManageIQ will prompt you to add new providers automatically.
