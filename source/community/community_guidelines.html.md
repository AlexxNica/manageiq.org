## ManageIQ Community Guidelines

To ensure that the ManageIQ community is a fun and productive place to learn,
share, and work with the ManageIQ cloud management platform, we have some
guidelines for how we expect our community members to behave. Please be
respectful of your fellow ManageIQ community members, whether they are
using or developing the platform.

### Be involved

The ManageIQ community's growth and prosperity depends on each one of us
contributing our skills and knowledge for each other's benefit. Take time to
ask and answer questions in the forums or on IRC, share solutions to problems
you have addressed with ManageIQ, or help improve the platform by proposing
new features, getting involved with community testing of new releases, etc.
By sharing our collective wisdom widely, we all benefit.

If you are interested in helping, and you are not sure where to get started,
[drop us a line](mailto:contact@manageiq.org).

### Be helpful

The purpose of this site is to give users of ManageIQ a place to gather,
share knowledge and solve cloud management problems. Please help your
fellow users with questions as much as you are able to do so, and share as
much detailed information as you can when asking and answering questions.

Please do stay on topic - developer topics on [Talk](http://talk.manageiq.org)
should be in the "Developers" category, topics related to using and
customizing ManageIQ should be in the "Users" category. The best place to
get an answer to a question is in [Ask](http://ask.manageiq.org).

### Be polite

We are a global community of developers and users, and we want to create
a productive environment where we can all learn together. Please keep
discussions on topic and the content and tone of your posts legal and
professional. Any racial, sexual, geographical, or other abuse will not be
tolerated.

### We're here for you

Communication with a global community can be richly rewarding and, at
times, problematic. That's OK - we're here to help. If you're having any
difficulties communicating effectively with your fellow users, please
[let us know](mailto:contact@manageiq.org).

If you feel that another community member has over-stepped the bounds in
these guidelines, please [do not hesitate to contact
us](mailto:contact@manageiq.org) - all incidents are treated confidentially
and will be dealt with.

## Specific Guidelines

### [Talk](http://talk.manageiq.org) and [Ask](http://ask.manageiq.org)

* Please search before asking - your question may have been asked before,
  and even if the answer is out of date, adding a new comment there may
  result in an improved or updated answer for everyone.
* Ask smart questions - a good question shows your work, describes what you
  have tried and what has not worked, and helps people answer your question
  better and more quickly.

### IRC

* IRC is a real-time chat protocol, but often the person best able to answer
  a question will not be around when you ask. Please be patient after asking
  a question, and keep the channel open. You may get your answer some time
  later.
* Please do not copy & paste multiple lines of text into IRC. Use a paste
  service like [fpaste](http://fpaste.org) instead.
* Please avoid private messages to people you do not know well. Some people
  do not like them, and it benefits the community to have questions asked
  and answered in channel instead.

### Issues

* Please create a different issue for each problem you want to report.
* Please search before reporting an issue - many issues have been reported
  in the past, and may already have been fixed or a workaround documented.
* What makes a good issue report is a good, descriptive description, a
  detailed description of how you encountered the issue, and information on
  what version you are using and what behaviour you expected.
