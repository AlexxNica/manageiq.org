      ## Governance

      The ManageIQ project is a meritocracy. We practice open and transparent
      planning and development. As a project participant, you get a say in the
      features we will prioritize in future versions, you can see feature
      planning and code contributions [as they
      happen](http://github.com/ManageIQ), and you can propose your own changes
      via pull requests.

      All code contributed to the core of the project is contributed under a
      dual license: GPL v2 and Apache License v2. All modules distributed
      through market.manageiq.org must be licensed under an OSI approved
      license.
