# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

The ManageIQ development team uses Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for real-time communication, in the `#manageiq` channel on `irc.freenode.net`.

If you are new to IRC, you can learn more about using it at [IRC help](http://www.irchelp.org/). For guidelines on communicating on IRC, please read the appropriate section in [our community guidelines](community_guidelines). Further suggestions can be found on [Freenode's channel guidelines](http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml).

On Windows or Linux, most developers use dedicated IRC software such as
[HexChat](http://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/lates/getting_started.html),
[X-Chat](http://xchat.org/docs/start/),
[Konversation](http://docs.kde.org/development/en/extragear-network/konversation/using-kapp.html),
or [irssi](http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/). For MacOS X,
[Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) or [Adium](https://adium.im/) are popular.

It's also possible to connect to #manageiq on Freenode using your web browser below, or [in a new tab](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#manageiq).
