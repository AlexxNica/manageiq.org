      ## Submitting a patch

      ManageIQ is primarily written in Ruby, and is hosted on Github.
      All patches to ManageIQ should be submitted via pull requests on Github.
      The patch approval process is lightweight - patches and feature
      additions should be discussed on the [developer
      forum](http://talk.manageiq.org) and any member of the maintainer team
      can accept and integrate a patch
