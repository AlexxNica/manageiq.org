## Submitting a patch

ManageIQ is primarily written in Ruby, and is hosted on Github.
All patches to ManageIQ should be submitted via pull requests on Github.
The patch approval process is lightweight - patches and feature
additions should be discussed on the [developer
forum](http://talk.manageiq.org) and any member of the maintainer team
can accept and integrate a patch
