If you've been [following the recent sprints](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/milestones?state=closed), you know that [re-engineering the provider architecture](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/issues/1272) has been top of mind for the [Botvinnik release cycle](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/milestones/Roadmap). If you haven't been following, know that the provider architecture is what allows ManageIQ developers to add new IaaS providers, or configuration management providers, or allowing any kind of service provider to be matched to an application that utilizes it. In the past, adding new providers was a time-consuming, manual process, and the recent advances are intended to streamline and automate the process. 

To shed some light on recent efforts in this area, we're happy to have Jason Frey give an overview of the latest developments, and what's in store for Botvinnik and beyond.
