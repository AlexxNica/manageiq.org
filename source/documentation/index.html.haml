          ### What is ManageIQ?

          ManageIQ is a management and automation platform for virtual,
          private, and hybrid cloud infrastructures.

          ManageIQ, Inc. _was_ a startup founded in 2006 and acquired by
          Red Hat in late 2012. The name lives on in the form of this
          community and open source project.

          ### ManageIQ&rsquo;s audience

          ManageIQ is intended for a diverse array of people, from
          developers who want to use [cloud
          APIs](/documentation/development/rest_api/reference/) in
          applications to operations staff who want a single
          interface for cloud and virtualization platforms.

          ManageIQ provides an easier way to automate cloud
          workloads. A build-test-deploy use case is a typical scenario
          in which ManageIQ shines.
