        %h3 What is ManageIQ? 
        ManageIQ is a management and automation platform for virtual, private, and hybrid cloud infrastructures. It lets cloud and virtualization administrators centrally manage and automate workload lifecycles through self-service provisioning and IT process workflows, as well as assess capacity and utilization, enforce quotas, and orchestrate post-provisioning operations. ManageIQ, Inc. was a startup founded in 2006 and acquired by Red Hat in late 2012. The name lives on in the form of this community and open source project.

        %h3 Who is it for?
        ManageIQ is a platform designed from the ground up for modern devops workloads. It is intended for a diverse array of people, from the developers who need to utilize cloud APIs in their applications to the operations staff who need a single interface for all of the cloud and virtualization platforms they manage. It provides a convenient API for developers and an easier way to automate cloud workloads. A build-test-deploy use case is a typical scenario in which ManageIQ shines.
