The Red Hat CloudForms appliance is a virtual machine image that runs on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based operating system. It is advisable to perform some tasks in the appliance (i.e changing the root password and setting ssh keys)

1. The appliance database has already been configured in the Docker and Vagrant installations. If you are using other types of appliances (like OpenStack, VMware or Openstack) follow the documentation for your provider to configure.
1. Point your browser to its IP address
    * Docker: localhost (127.0.0.1)
    * Vagrant: 172.28.128.3
