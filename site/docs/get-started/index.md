## What is ManageIQ?

Agile, Efficient and Risk Managed IT infrastructure, through:

* Continuous discovery of managed environments.
* Unified operations management across hybrid footprints.
* Self-service with complete life-cycle management.
* Compliance enforcement for any changes, applied or discovered.
* Platform based approach, allowing for fast implementation and coexistence with other management tools


## Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Control Policy | Policies are used to manage your virtual environment. There are two types of policies available: compliance and control. Compliance policies are used to harden your virtual infrastructure, making sure that your security requirements are adhered to. Control policies are used to check for a specific condition and perform an action based on the outcome |
| Providers | A provider is a server with software to manage multiple virtual machines that reside on multiple hosts. |
| Virtual Management Database (VMDB) | A database that stores the intelligence collected about the virtual infrastructure. |
| Role-based Access Control (RBAC) | |
| Service User Interface (SUI) | |
| Smart State Analysis | |

## Following this Guide

In order to follow this guide, you need to have a computer that allows you to run the software and a provider to connect to.
You should have installed the software following one of the installation guides or documentation, and you should be able to connect to the appliance and log in into the interface.
Current options are:
Docker (if you use the Docker option)
Vagrant (if you use the Vagrant option)

You would also need a system to manage, we will use a free sign-up  Google Cloud Platform account for testing, but you can use any provider supported by ManageIQ
