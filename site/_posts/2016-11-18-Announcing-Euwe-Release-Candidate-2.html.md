On behalf of the ManageIQ team, we're pleased to announce the Release Candidate 2 of ManageIQ Euwe!

Euwe is the next milestone release for ManageIQ cloud and virtualization management platform. With each release, ManageIQ gets more robust and feature complete across providers. Since the Euwe-RC-1 release, we further concentrated on stablization fixes as well as numerous performance improvements prior to the upcoming GA release.

* **Added Google** pre and post provisioning methods.
* **Backend support** to enable VMware provisioning through selection of a DRS-enabled cluster instead of a host.
* **Restored retirement logic** to verify that VM was provisioned or contains Lifecycle tag before processing.
* **REST API** Adding support for /api/requests creation and edits.
