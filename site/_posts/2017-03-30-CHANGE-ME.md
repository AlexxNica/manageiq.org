## Improved

Day by day, week by week, we try to make ManageIQ better and better.
From last week there was a Pull Request from bdunne fixing creating of catalog
item (https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/14468) or adjusting styling of
power state images from epwinchell (https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/pull/813).

### <pr 1>
### <pr 2>

## Fixed

With the amount of code that is submitted into ManageIQ, it is possible
some issues are introduced. This week, @skateman has helped to keep the
ManageIQ UI nice by fixing issue with
quadicons (https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/pull/778).
Also @kbrock has sped up UI by makeing Widget run without
timezones (https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/14386).

### <pr 1>
### <pr 2>

## New

Of cource, we have also added a lot of new code. Eric Hayes has
added a cache for full Feature objects (https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/14037),
that should even speed up RBAC features tree.
New code was also added for Ansible by Nick Carboni, he has added a concern
for storing and accessing embedded ansible object ids https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/14377.

### <pr 1>
### <pr 2>

## Deleted

There has been a lot of code added to the codebase of ManageIQ from the last week,
but it's important not to forget to remove what is not needed anymore. Just
like did @syncrou in https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/14415 or
@himdel in https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/pull/725.

### <pr 1>
### <pr 2>

That's all folks. See you next week at next LWIMIQ post, by @PanSpagetka
